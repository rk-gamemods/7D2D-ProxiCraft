[color=#ff0000][b]🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Multiplayer Container Crash[/b][/color]

Fixed a bug causing a [b]100% crash rate[/b] in multiplayer. Opening *any* container (chest, mailbox, etc.) would instantly disconnect all clients.
The root cause was an infinite loop in the network code. If your server disconnected everyone whenever a box was opened, this update fixes it immediately.

[size=2][i]Technical: Fixed infinite recursion in NetPackagePCLock due to incorrect base method call syntax (`((NetPackage)this)` vs `base`).[/i][/size]

[b]New Feature: Performance Profiler[/b]
A diagnostic tool to definitively prove if ProxiCraft is causing lag. This instruments [b]every[/b] ProxiCraft patch with microsecond-precision timers.

[b]What it tells you:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Proof of Innocence:[/b] Shows exactly how much time ProxiCraft takes per frame. If our numbers are low, you can rule us out and look elsewhere.
[*][b]Health Metrics:[/b] Tracks Frame Hitches, Lock Contention, and GC Pressure. Useful for A/B testing performance between different mod loadouts.
[*][b]Limitations:[/b] It determines if [i]ProxiCraft[/i] is the problem. It cannot identify which [i]other[/i] mod might be lagging your game.
[/list]

[b]How to use:[/b]
1. Console (F1) → [font=courier]pc perf on[/font]
2. Play until lag occurs.
