[size=4][b]ProxiCraft v1.2.12[/b][/size]

Bug fix release for block upgrade material consumption.

[b]Bug Fixes:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Fixed double material consumption during block upgrades[/b] - When upgrade materials were split between player inventory and nearby containers, the game would consume items twice. Now correctly accounts for what vanilla already consumed.
[*][b]Fixed "r" shorthand in upgrade item resolution[/b] - Blocks using the vanilla "r" shorthand for UpgradeBlock.Item were not resolved correctly, potentially breaking upgrades on modded blocks using this pattern.
