## ProxiCraft v1.2.3

### Summary
Configuration change: Enhanced safety mode now enabled by default for better multiplayer stability.

### Changes
- **Enhanced Safety Defaults Changed**: All `enhancedSafety*` settings now default to `true` (recommended for multiplayer)
- **Configuration Documentation Expanded**: NEXUS_DESCRIPTION.txt Configuration section now documents all 30+ settings comprehensively organized by category
- **No Functional Changes**: This is a default configuration change only - no code changes

**Note for Existing Users**: If you have a custom `config.json`, your settings are unchanged. Only new installations will use the new defaults.

### What is Enhanced Safety Mode?

Enhanced Safety Mode routes all storage operations through a centralized `VirtualInventoryProvider` class, providing:
- More consistent multiplayer behavior
- Simplified code paths (easier to maintain and debug)
- No performance cost
- Functionally equivalent to standard mode for single-player

Previously marked as "experimental" and disabled by default, testing has shown this mode to be robust and safe. It's now the recommended default for all users, especially those playing multiplayer.

### Installation
1. Download ProxiCraft-1.2.3.zip
2. Extract and copy ProxiCraft folder to `7 Days To Die/Mods/`
3. Launch game with EAC disabled

**Multiplayer**: Install on server AND all clients (same version)

### Configuration

Edit `config.json` in your mod folder: `7 Days To Die/Mods/ProxiCraft/config.json`

After making changes, reload in-game with: `pc reload` (F1 console)

The enhanced safety settings are now:
```json
{
  "enhancedSafetyCrafting": true,
  "enhancedSafetyReload": true,
  "enhancedSafetyRepairAndUpgrade": true,
  "enhancedSafetyVehicleRepair": true,
  "enhancedSafetyRefuel": true,
  "enhancedSafetyDiagnosticLogging": false
}
```

You can still disable them if you prefer the standard mode or experience any issues.
