Network Stability & Robustness Improvements

[b]Fixed:[/b]
[list]
[*]Fixed multiplayer handshake packet loss causing mod to lock up for entire server session
[*]Fixed orphan container locks when players disconnect (containers no longer stay "locked" forever)
[*]Fixed race condition where out-of-order packets could cause ghost locks
[*]Added lock expiration (30s default) - ghost locks self-heal automatically
[*]Added retry mechanism for handshake and lock broadcasts on connection hiccups
[*]Added lock retry cancellation to prevent stale locks after rapid open/close
[*]Improved error handling in packet deserialization
[/list]

[b]Robustness Improvements:[/b]
Added defensive measures for rare edge cases that could cause crashes during item removal:
[list]
[*]Pre-check TileEntity.IsRemoving before container access (prevents crash if block destroyed mid-operation)
[*]Chunk read locks with proper finally blocks during TileEntity modification (prevents crash if chunk unloads)
[*]Defensive bounds and null checks in all item iteration loops (prevents IndexOutOfRange/NullRef)
[*]Try-catch wrappers for EntityStorage and TileEntity operations with automatic cleanup
[*]Crash prevention logging with [CrashPrevention] prefix for diagnostics
[/list]

[b]Installation:[/b]
[list]
[*]Download ProxiCraft-1.2.7.zip
[*]Extract to your 7 Days to Die Mods folder
[*]Result: 7DaysToDie/Mods/ProxiCraft/
