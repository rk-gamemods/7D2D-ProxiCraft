================================================================================
BRIEF OVERVIEW (350 character limit)
================================================================================

Stop searching through storage boxes for crafting ingredients. ProxiCraft automatically pulls items from nearby containers for crafting, reloading, refueling, and repairs. Unlike similar mods, it works with challenge trackers - items in containers count toward quests. Configurable range and conflict detection included.

Character count: 342

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (BBCode)
================================================================================

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft lets you use items stored in nearby containers for:
[list]
[*]Crafting recipes
[*]Reloading weapons
[*]Refueling vehicles and generators
[*]Repairing and upgrading blocks
[*]Buying from traders
[*]Painting blocks
[*]Lockpicking locked containers
[*]Repairing weapons and tools
[/list]

[b]Storage Sources:[/b]
[list]
[*]Standard storage containers (chests, boxes, crates)
[*]Vehicle storage (4x4, motorcycle, gyrocopter, minibike)
[*]Drone cargo compartment
[*]Dew collector contents
[*]Workstation output slots (forge, workbench, campfire, chemistry station)
[/list]

You no longer need to move items to your backpack first. If the item is in a container within range, the game will use it automatically.

[size=4][b]How Is This Different From Craft From Containers?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft was inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2196]Craft From Containers by aedenthorn[/url]. If you want the original, check out their mod.

ProxiCraft is a complete rewrite with a different architecture:

[b]Less Likely to Conflict[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Low-Priority Patches[/b] - All patches use Harmony Priority.Low, so other mods run first. We add to their results instead of fighting them.
[*][b]Additive Design[/b] - We add container items to inventory queries. We never replace or override what other mods do.
[*][b]Postfix Over Transpiler[/b] - We use less invasive patch types when possible. Transpilers break easily; postfixes don't.
[/list]

[b]More Stable[/b]
[list]
[*][b]SafePatcher System[/b] - Every patch is wrapped in error handling. If something fails, that feature is disabled instead of crashing your game.
[*][b]Graceful Degradation[/b] - If a game update changes something, the mod adapts. Features that can't work are turned off automatically.
[*][b]Null Safety[/b] - Defensive coding throughout. No crashes from unexpected game states.
[/list]

[b]More Features[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Challenge Tracker Integration[/b] - Container items count toward "Gather X" quests. This is not available in other versions.
[*][b]Expanded Storage Sources[/b] - Pull from vehicles, drones, dew collectors, and workstation outputs
[*][b]Painting Support[/b] - Use paint cans from storage with the paint brush tool
[*][b]Lockpicking Support[/b] - Use lockpicks stored in nearby containers
[*][b]Generator Refuel[/b] - Refuel generators and power sources from nearby storage
[*][b]Item Repair[/b] - Repair weapons and tools using repair kits from containers
[*][b]Balanced Default Range[/b] - 15 blocks by default instead of unlimited. Better for gameplay balance.
[*][b]Per-Feature Control[/b] - Enable or disable crafting, reloading, refueling, and trading separately.
[*][b]Console Diagnostics[/b] - Run [b]pc status[/b], [b]pc test[/b], [b]pc conflicts[/b] to troubleshoot issues.
[*][b]Container Caching[/b] - Performance optimized. Limits scanning to 10 times per second max.
[*][b]Startup Health Check[/b] - Validates all features when the game loads. Silent when everything works, warns you if features break.
[*][b]Auto-Adaptation[/b] - Mod attempts to survive game updates by finding renamed methods automatically.
[/list]

[b]Important:[/b] Use only ONE craft-from-containers mod. Remove CraftFromContainers or similar mods before using ProxiCraft.

[/list]

[b]Feature Toggles[/b]
[list]
[*][b]enableForCrafting[/b] - Use materials from containers for crafting
[*][b]enableForQuests[/b] - Count container items toward "Gather X" challenge objectives

[b]Debug[/b]
[list]

[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Design Decisions[/b][/size]

[b]Workstation Output Slots Only[/b]

When pulling items from workstations (forge, workbench, chemistry station, campfire), ProxiCraft [b]only counts OUTPUT slots[/b]. Input, fuel, and tool slots are intentionally ignored.

[b]Why?[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Output slots[/b] - Finished products ready to use ✓
[*][b]Input slots[/b] - Items actively being processed/consumed ✗
[*][b]Fuel slots[/b] - Fuel is being burned, not available ✗
[*][b]Tool slots[/b] - Tools are in use (anvil, beaker, etc.) ✗
[/list]

[b]Example:[/b] You put 100 iron ore in the forge. You should NOT be able to craft iron bars from that ore - it's actively being smelted. But once the iron bars appear in the output slot, those ARE available for crafting.

Not tested in multiplayer. The mod may work, but shared containers could cause problems if two players craft from the same container at the same time.
