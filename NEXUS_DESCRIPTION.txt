================================================================================
BRIEF OVERVIEW (350 character limit)
================================================================================

Stop searching through storage boxes for crafting ingredients. ProxiCraft automatically pulls items from nearby containers for crafting, reloading, refueling, and repairs. Unlike similar mods, it works with challenge trackers - items in containers count toward quests. Configurable range and conflict detection included.

Character count: 342

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (BBCode)
================================================================================

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft lets you use items stored in nearby containers for:
[list]
[*]Crafting recipes
[*]Reloading weapons
[*]Refueling vehicles and generators
[*]Repairing and upgrading blocks
[*]Buying from traders
[*]Painting blocks
[*]Lockpicking locked containers
[*]Repairing weapons and tools
[/list]

[b]Storage Sources:[/b]
[list]
[*]Standard storage containers (chests, boxes, crates)
[*]Vehicle storage (4x4, motorcycle, gyrocopter, minibike)
[*]Drone cargo compartment
[*]Dew collector contents
[*]Workstation output slots (forge, workbench, campfire, chemistry station)
[/list]

You no longer need to move items to your backpack first. If the item is in a container within range, the game will use it automatically.

[size=4][b]How Is This Different From Craft From Containers?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft was inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2196]Craft From Containers by aedenthorn[/url]. If you want the original, check out their mod.

ProxiCraft is a complete rewrite with a different architecture:

[b]Less Likely to Conflict[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Low-Priority Patches[/b] - All patches use Harmony Priority.Low, so other mods run first. We add to their results instead of fighting them.
[*][b]Additive Design[/b] - We add container items to inventory queries. We never replace or override what other mods do.
[*][b]Postfix Over Transpiler[/b] - We use less invasive patch types when possible. Transpilers break easily; postfixes don't.
[/list]

[b]More Stable[/b]
[list]
[*][b]SafePatcher System[/b] - Every patch is wrapped in error handling. If something fails, that feature is disabled instead of crashing your game.
[*][b]Graceful Degradation[/b] - If a game update changes something, the mod adapts. Features that can't work are turned off automatically.
[*][b]Null Safety[/b] - Defensive coding throughout. No crashes from unexpected game states.
[/list]

[b]More Features[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Challenge Tracker Integration[/b] - Container items count toward "Gather X" quests. This is not available in other versions.
[*][b]Expanded Storage Sources[/b] - Pull from vehicles, drones, dew collectors, and workstation outputs
[*][b]Painting Support[/b] - Use paint cans from storage with the paint brush tool
[*][b]Lockpicking Support[/b] - Use lockpicks stored in nearby containers
[*][b]Generator Refuel[/b] - Refuel generators and power sources from nearby storage
[*][b]Item Repair[/b] - Repair weapons and tools using repair kits from containers
[*][b]Balanced Default Range[/b] - 15 blocks by default instead of unlimited. Better for gameplay balance.
[*][b]Per-Feature Control[/b] - Enable or disable crafting, reloading, refueling, and trading separately.
[*][b]Console Diagnostics[/b] - Run [b]pc status[/b], [b]pc test[/b], [b]pc conflicts[/b] to troubleshoot issues.
[*][b]Container Caching[/b] - Performance optimized. Limits scanning to 10 times per second max.
[*][b]Startup Health Check[/b] - Validates all features when the game loads. Silent when everything works, warns you if features break.
[*][b]Auto-Adaptation[/b] - Mod attempts to survive game updates by finding renamed methods automatically.
[/list]

[b]Important:[/b] Use only ONE craft-from-containers mod. Remove CraftFromContainers or similar mods before using ProxiCraft.

[size=4][b]Inspired By Beyond Storage 2[/b][/size]

The expanded storage sources in v1.1.0 (vehicles, drones, dew collectors, workstation outputs) were inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/7809]Beyond Storage 2 by superguru[/url]. If you want a feature-rich alternative, check out their mod.

Choose whichever mod fits your needs. Do not use both simultaneously.

[b]Range Settings[/b]
[list]
[*][b]range[/b] - How far to search for containers (in blocks). Default is 15, which covers a typical base floor. Set to -1 for unlimited (searches all loaded chunks, may cause lag). Set higher if you have a large base.
[/list]

[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Design Decisions[/b][/size]

[b]Workstation Output Slots Only[/b]

When pulling items from workstations (forge, workbench, chemistry station, campfire), ProxiCraft [b]only counts OUTPUT slots[/b]. Input, fuel, and tool slots are intentionally ignored.

[b]Why?[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Output slots[/b] - Finished products ready to use ✓
[*][b]Input slots[/b] - Items actively being processed/consumed ✗
[*][b]Fuel slots[/b] - Fuel is being burned, not available ✗
[*][b]Tool slots[/b] - Tools are in use (anvil, beaker, etc.) ✗
[/list]

[b]Example:[/b] You put 100 iron ore in the forge. You should NOT be able to craft iron bars from that ore - it's actively being smelted. But once the iron bars appear in the output slot, those ARE available for crafting.

[u]Mod Conflicts in Multiplayer:[/u]
Do NOT mix different container mods between client and server:
[list]
[*]Server runs Beyond Storage 2? Use BS2 on client (not ProxiCraft)
[*]Server runs ProxiCraft? Use ProxiCraft on client (not BS2)
[*]Mixing container mods will cause crashes
