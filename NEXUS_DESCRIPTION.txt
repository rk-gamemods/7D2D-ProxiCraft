DETAILED DESCRIPTION (BBCode)
================================================================================

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft lets you use items stored in nearby containers for:
[list]
[*]Crafting recipes
[*]Reloading weapons
[*]Refueling vehicles and generators
[*]Repairing and upgrading blocks
[*]Buying from traders
[*]Painting blocks
[*]Lockpicking locked containers
[*]Repairing weapons and tools
[/list]

[b]Storage Sources:[/b]
[list]
[*]Standard storage containers (chests, boxes, crates)
[*]Vehicle storage (4x4, motorcycle, gyrocopter, minibike)
[*]Drone cargo compartment
[*]Dew collector contents
[*]Workstation output slots (forge, workbench, campfire, chemistry station)
[/list]

You no longer need to move items to your backpack first. If the item is in a container within range, the game will use it automatically.

[size=4][b]🧪 EXPERIMENTAL: Multiplayer Support[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft v1.2.1 introduces experimental multiplayer support with a unique architecture:

[b]Virtual Inventory System[/b]

Unlike traditional mods that patch individual game methods, ProxiCraft uses a [b]centralized Virtual Inventory Provider[/b] - a single class that ALL storage-aware operations flow through.

[code]

[/code]

[b]Why This Matters:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Single Point of Control[/b] - All storage access flows through one class
[*][b]Consistent Safety Checks[/b] - Multiplayer validation happens in ONE place
[*][b]Bug Fixes Apply Globally[/b] - Fix a bug once, it's fixed everywhere
[*][b]Zero Crash Window[/b] - Storage access is blocked instantly when unsafe
[/list]

[b]"Guilty Until Proven Innocent" Protection[/b]

When ANY client connects:
[list=1]
[*][b]IMMEDIATE LOCK[/b] - Storage access blocked instantly (zero crash window)
[*][b]Verification Handshake[/b] - Client must prove they have ProxiCraft
[*][b]Unlock on Success[/b] - Once verified (~100-300ms), normal operation resumes
[*][b]Culprit Identification[/b] - If verification fails, the player without the mod is identified by name
[/list]

No crashes during verification. No guessing who needs the mod. Auto-enables when problematic player disconnects.

[b]Experimental Status:[/b] This feature works well in testing but multiplayer has many edge cases. Report issues with [b]pc fullcheck[/b] output.

[line]

[size=4][b]How Is This Different From Similar Mods?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft was inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2196]Craft From Containers by aedenthorn[/url]. If you want the original, check out their mod.

ProxiCraft is a complete rewrite with a different architecture:

[b]Less Likely to Conflict[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Low-Priority Patches[/b] - All patches use Harmony Priority.Low, so other mods run first. We add to their results instead of fighting them.
[*][b]Additive Design[/b] - We add container items to inventory queries. We never replace or override what other mods do.
[*][b]Postfix Over Transpiler[/b] - We use less invasive patch types when possible. Transpilers break easily; postfixes don't.
[/list]

[b]More Stable[/b]
[list]
[*][b]SafePatcher System[/b] - Every patch is wrapped in error handling. If something fails, that feature is disabled instead of crashing your game.
[*][b]Graceful Degradation[/b] - If a game update changes something, the mod adapts. Features that can't work are turned off automatically.
[*][b]Null Safety[/b] - Defensive coding throughout. No crashes from unexpected game states.
[/list]

[b]More Features[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Challenge Tracker Integration[/b] - Container items count toward "Gather X" quests. This is not available in other versions.
[*][b]Virtual Inventory Architecture[/b] - Centralized, multiplayer-safe storage access
[*][b]Expanded Storage Sources[/b] - Pull from vehicles, drones, dew collectors, and workstation outputs
[*][b]Painting Support[/b] - Use paint cans from storage with the paint brush tool
[*][b]Lockpicking Support[/b] - Use lockpicks stored in nearby containers
[*][b]Generator Refuel[/b] - Refuel generators and power sources from nearby storage
[*][b]Item Repair[/b] - Repair weapons and tools using repair kits from containers
[*][b]Balanced Default Range[/b] - 15 blocks by default instead of unlimited. Better for gameplay balance.
[*][b]Per-Feature Control[/b] - Enable or disable crafting, reloading, refueling, and trading separately.
[*][b]Console Diagnostics[/b] - Run [b]pc status[/b], [b]pc test[/b], [b]pc conflicts[/b] to troubleshoot issues.
[*][b]Container Caching[/b] - Performance optimized. Limits scanning to 10 times per second max.
[*][b]Startup Health Check[/b] - Validates all features when the game loads. Silent when everything works, warns you if features break.
[*][b]Auto-Adaptation[/b] - Mod attempts to survive game updates by finding renamed methods automatically.
[/list]

[b]Important:[/b] Use only ONE craft-from-containers mod. Remove CraftFromContainers or similar mods before using ProxiCraft.

[line]

[size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size]

}
[/code]

[b]Range Settings[/b]
[list]
[*][b]range[/b] - How far to search for containers (in blocks). Default is 15, which covers a typical base floor. Set to -1 for unlimited (searches all loaded chunks, may cause lag). Set higher if you have a large base.
[/list]

[b]Storage Source Toggles[/b]
[list]
[*][b]pullFromVehicles[/b] - Include vehicle storage (4x4, motorcycle, etc.)

[/list]

[b]Feature Toggles[/b]
[list]
[*][b]enableForCrafting[/b] - Use materials from containers for crafting
[*][b]enableForQuests[/b] - Count container items toward "Gather X" challenge objectives

[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Design Decisions[/b][/size]

[b]Workstation Output Slots Only[/b]

When pulling items from workstations (forge, workbench, chemistry station, campfire), ProxiCraft [b]only counts OUTPUT slots[/b]. Input, fuel, and tool slots are intentionally ignored.

[b]Why?[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Output slots[/b] - Finished products ready to use ✓
[*][b]Input slots[/b] - Items actively being processed/consumed ✗
[*][b]Fuel slots[/b] - Fuel is being burned, not available ✗
[*][b]Tool slots[/b] - Tools are in use (anvil, beaker, etc.) ✗
[/list]

[b]Virtual Inventory Architecture[/b]

All storage-aware operations flow through a central [b]VirtualInventoryProvider[/b] class:
[list]
[*][b]Centralizes multiplayer safety[/b] - One place to gate all storage access
[*][b]Ensures consistency[/b] - All features use the same counting/consumption logic
[*][b]Simplifies debugging[/b] - Problems traced to one location
[*][b]Enables global fixes[/b] - Fix a bug once, fixed everywhere
[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]Console Commands[/b][/size]

Press F1 to open the console, then type:
[list]
[*][b]pc status[/b] - Check if the mod is working
[*][b]pc health[/b] - Show startup health check results

[/list]

[line]

[size=4][b]🧪 Multiplayer (EXPERIMENTAL)[/b][/size]

[b]IMPORTANT:[/b] ProxiCraft must be installed on BOTH client AND server for multiplayer games.

[b]Private/Co-op Games:[/b] If one player hosts (not a dedicated server), the hosting player IS the server. ALL players must have ProxiCraft installed.

[u]Virtual Inventory Protection:[/u]

ProxiCraft's unique Virtual Inventory architecture provides automatic protection:
[list]
[*][b]IMMEDIATE LOCK[/b] - Storage access blocked the instant ANY client connects
[*][b]Zero Crash Window[/b] - No vulnerability during verification
[*][b]Culprit Identification[/b] - Shows exactly which player needs the mod
[*][b]Auto Re-enable[/b] - Mod enables again when problematic player disconnects
[/list]

[u]Server Config Sync:[/u]
When joining a server, [b]your local settings are automatically overridden[/b] with the server's settings (range, features, priority). This prevents desync issues.

[u]Experimental Status:[/u]
This feature is marked experimental because multiplayer has many edge cases. Report issues with [b]pc fullcheck[/b] output.
