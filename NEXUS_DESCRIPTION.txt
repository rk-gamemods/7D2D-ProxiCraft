[b]Safety Features:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Immediate Lock[/b] - Storage access blocked instantly when any client connects (zero crash window)
[*][b]Quick Unlock[/b] - Resumes in ~100-300ms after verifying client has mod installed
[*][b]Culprit Identification[/b] - Shows exactly which player needs to install the mod
[*][b]Auto Re-enable[/b] - Mod unlocks when the player without ProxiCraft disconnects
[*][b]Server Config Sync[/b] - Clients automatically use server's settings (range, features, priority)
[/list]

[b]Safety Settings (config.json):[/b]
[code]
{
  "multiplayerImmediateLock": true,
  "multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds": 10
}
[/code]

[list]
[*][b]multiplayerImmediateLock[/b] (default: true) - Lock mod when clients connect. Set to [b]false[/b] to disable safety lock entirely (honor system - NOT RECOMMENDED except on moderated servers where you enforce mod installation externally).
[*][b]multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds[/b] (default: 10) - How long to wait before declaring a player doesn't have the mod.
[/list]

⚠️ [b]WARNING:[/b] Setting [b]multiplayerImmediateLock=false[/b] removes crash protection. If ANY player joins without ProxiCraft, the server may crash. Only use on servers where you control who joins.

[list]
[*]Single player ✓
[*]Basic dedicated server ✓
[*]Co-op hosting ⚠️ (needs more testing)
