================================================================================
BRIEF OVERVIEW (350 character limit)
================================================================================

Stop searching through storage boxes for crafting ingredients. ProxiCraft automatically pulls items from nearby containers for crafting, reloading, refueling, and repairs. Unlike similar mods, it works with challenge trackers - items in containers count toward quests. Configurable range and conflict detection included.

Character count: 342

DETAILED DESCRIPTION (BBCode)
================================================================================

[size=4][b]What Does This Mod Do?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft lets you use items stored in nearby containers for:
[list]
[*]Crafting recipes
[*]Reloading weapons
[*]Refueling vehicles
[*]Repairing and upgrading blocks
[*]Buying from traders
[/list]

You no longer need to move items to your backpack first. If the item is in a container within range, the game will use it automatically.

[size=4][b]How Is This Different From Craft From Containers?[/b][/size]

ProxiCraft was inspired by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2196]Craft From Containers by aedenthorn[/url]. If you want the original, check out their mod.

ProxiCraft is a complete rewrite with a different architecture:

[b]Less Likely to Conflict[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Low-Priority Patches[/b] - All patches use Harmony Priority.Low, so other mods run first. We add to their results instead of fighting them.
[*][b]Additive Design[/b] - We add container items to inventory queries. We never replace or override what other mods do.
[*][b]Postfix Over Transpiler[/b] - We use less invasive patch types when possible. Transpilers break easily; postfixes don't.
[/list]

[b]More Stable[/b]
[list]
[*][b]SafePatcher System[/b] - Every patch is wrapped in error handling. If something fails, that feature is disabled instead of crashing your game.
[*][b]Graceful Degradation[/b] - If a game update changes something, the mod adapts. Features that can't work are turned off automatically.
[*][b]Null Safety[/b] - Defensive coding throughout. No crashes from unexpected game states.
[/list]

[b]More Features[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Challenge Tracker Integration[/b] - Container items count toward "Gather X" quests. This is not available in other versions.
[*][b]Balanced Default Range[/b] - 15 blocks by default instead of unlimited. Better for gameplay balance.
[*][b]Per-Feature Control[/b] - Enable or disable crafting, reloading, refueling, and trading separately.
[*][b]Console Diagnostics[/b] - Run [b]pc status[/b], [b]pc test[/b], [b]pc conflicts[/b] to troubleshoot issues.
[*][b]Container Caching[/b] - Performance optimized. Limits scanning to 10 times per second max.
[/list]

[b]Important:[/b] Use only ONE craft-from-containers mod. Remove CraftFromContainers or similar mods before using ProxiCraft.
