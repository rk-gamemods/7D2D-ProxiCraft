Fixes drone inventory being counted multiple times in crafting calculations.

[b]Changes:[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Fixed drone inventory double-count bug[/b] - Drone items were counted multiple times because the storage dictionary used the drone's position as a key. Since drones follow the player and constantly move, each position change created a new entry referencing the same items. This inflated craft-max values but crafting would fail because the real items only existed once. Fixed by keying mobile entity storage (drones and vehicles) by entity ID instead of position.
