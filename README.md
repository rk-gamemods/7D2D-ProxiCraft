**Safety Features:**
- **Immediate Lock** - Storage access blocked instantly when any client connects (zero crash window)
- **Quick Unlock** - Resumes in ~100-300ms after verifying client has mod
- **Culprit Identification** - Shows exactly which player needs to install the mod
- **Auto Re-enable** - Mod unlocks when the player without ProxiCraft disconnects
- **Server Config Sync** - Clients automatically use server's settings

**Safety Settings (config.json):**

```json
{
  "multiplayerImmediateLock": true,
  "multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds": 10
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `multiplayerImmediateLock` | true | Lock mod when clients connect. Set to `false` for honor system (NOT RECOMMENDED). |
| `multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds` | 10 | How long to wait before declaring a player doesn't have the mod. |

⚠️ **WARNING:** Setting `multiplayerImmediateLock=false` removes crash protection. Only use on moderated servers where you enforce mod installation externally.

**Settings Sync Behavior:**
- **Server-synced:** `range`, all `pullFrom*`, all `enableFor*`, `storagePriority`, `respectLockedSlots`, `allowLockedContainers`
- **Local-only (never synced):** `isDebug`, `modEnabled`, `verboseHealthCheck`, `multiplayerImmediateLock`, `multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds`, all `enhancedSafety*` settings

Debug logging cannot be enabled remotely by a server - each player controls their own logging.

**Testing Status:**
- Single player ✅
- Basic dedicated server ✅
- Co-op hosting ⚠️ (needs more testing)
- High-latency connections ⚠️ (needs more testing)
- Large player counts (8+) ⚠️ (needs more testing)

**🐛 Please Report Bugs!** Multiplayer has many edge cases. Run `pc fullcheck` - it saves `fullcheck_report.txt` to the mod folder. Attach that file to your report on GitHub or Nexus.

## Installation

### Single-Player

1. Download the zip using the link above
2. Extract to `7 Days To Die/Mods/ProxiCraft/`
3. Launch game with EAC disabled

### Multiplayer

1. Install on the **server**
2. Install on **ALL clients** (same version)
3. If hosting co-op: the host IS the server, so all players need the mod

---

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` in the mod folder:

```json
{
  "modEnabled": true,
  "isDebug": false,
  "range": 15,

  "pullFromVehicles": true,
  "pullFromDrones": true,
  "pullFromDewCollectors": true,
  "pullFromWorkstationOutputs": true,
  "allowLockedContainers": true,

  "storagePriority": {
    "Drone": "1",
    "DewCollector": "2",
    "Workstation": "3",
    "Container": "4",
    "Vehicle": "5"
  },

  "enableForCrafting": true,
  "enableForQuests": true,
  "enableForRepairAndUpgrade": true,
  "enableForLockpicking": true,
  "enableForItemRepair": true,
  "enableForPainting": true,
  "enableForReload": true,
  "enableForRefuel": true,
  "enableForTrader": true,
  "enableForGeneratorRefuel": true,

  "enableHudAmmoCounter": true,
  "enableRecipeTrackerUpdates": true,
  "respectLockedSlots": true
}
```

### Key Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `range` | 15 | Search radius in blocks. Use 5 (same room), 15 (same floor), 30 (entire building), or -1 (unlimited). |
| `isDebug` | false | Enable verbose logging to `pc_debug.log` in the mod folder. Use for troubleshooting. |
| `storagePriority` | See above | Lower number = checked first. Items pulled from first available source. |
| `respectLockedSlots` | true | Skip items in user-locked container slots. |
| `pullFromWorkstationOutputs` | true | Only OUTPUT slots counted (not input/fuel/tool). |

---

## Console Commands

Open console with F1:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pc status` | Show mod status, config, and multiplayer state |
| `pc health` | Show startup health check results |
| `pc test` | Test container scanning (shows what's found) |
| `pc fullcheck` | Full diagnostic (saves to `fullcheck_report.txt`) |
| `pc conflicts` | Check for mod conflicts |
| `pc toggle` | Enable/disable mod temporarily |
| `pc debug` | Toggle debug logging (writes to `pc_debug.log` in mod folder) |
| `pc reload` | Reload config from file |
| `pc perf on/off/report` | Performance profiling |

### Configuration Commands

```
pc config list              # List all settings
pc set range 30             # Change range to 30
pc config save              # Save changes to file
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Single-Player Issues

1. **Check status:** `pc status` - Is mod enabled?
2. **Check health:** `pc health` - Are features working?
3. **Test scanning:** `pc test` - Can mod see containers?
4. **Full report:** `pc fullcheck` - Saves `fullcheck_report.txt` for bug reports
5. **Enable debug:** `pc debug` or set `isDebug: true` - Writes detailed logs to `pc_debug.log` in mod folder

### Multiplayer Issues

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Multiplayer: LOCKED" in `pc status` | A player doesn't have ProxiCraft installed. Check who. |
| Features don't work for some players | Ensure ALL players have same mod version |
| Settings different than expected | Server settings override client. Check server's config.json |
| CTD on player join | Run `pc fullcheck`, attach `fullcheck_report.txt` |

### Stability Philosophy

ProxiCraft is designed to survive game updates:

| Tier | Features | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| **Stable** | Crafting, Quests, Block Repair, Lockpicking, Item Repair, Painting, HUD, Recipe Tracker | Low - Simple postfix patches |
| **Less Stable** | Reload, Vehicle Refuel, Generator Refuel, Trader | Medium - Transpiler patches |
| **Storage Sources** | Vehicles, Drones, Dew Collectors, Workstations | Low - Read-only, no patches |

**Startup Health Check:** Validates all 24 patches on game load. Silent when OK, warns on issues.

**Adaptive Recovery:** If game updates change method names, the mod attempts to find renamed methods automatically.

### Design Decisions

**Workstation Slots:** Only OUTPUT slots are counted. Input (being processed), fuel (being burned), and tool slots (in use) are ignored.

**Virtual Inventory Architecture:** All storage operations flow through `VirtualInventoryProvider` - centralizes multiplayer safety, ensures consistent behavior, enables global bug fixes.

### Multiplayer Network Architecture

#### Understanding Container Locks

**Important:** ProxiCraft's container lock system is a **UX courtesy**, not crash prevention.

**When are locks created?**
| Action | Lock Created? | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Player opens container UI (press E) | ✅ YES | Vanilla game creates lock |
| Player crafts using nearby storage | ❌ NO | No UI opened |
| Player repairs/upgrades block | ❌ NO | No UI opened |
| Player reloads weapon | ❌ NO | No UI opened |
| Player refuels vehicle/generator | ❌ NO | No UI opened |

**What locks protect:**
- When Player A has a container UI open, ProxiCraft tells other players to **skip** that container
- This prevents "where did my items go?" confusion when items disappear from an open UI
- **This is NOT required to prevent crashes** - just for better UX

**What if there were no locks?**
- Player A opens container, sees 10 concrete
- Player B repairs a block, ProxiCraft removes 1 concrete from that container
- Player A's UI still shows 10 until they close and reopen
- No crash, just mild confusion

**Multiple players using remote features (repair, reload, etc.):**
- These features **never create locks** because they never open container UIs
- Multiple players CAN pull from the same storage simultaneously
- The game processes requests sequentially (single-threaded)
- If two players need the last item, one gets it, one doesn't - normal resource contention
- **No crashes, no duplication, no issues**

#### Network Packets

| Packet | Direction | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `NetPackagePCHandshake` | Both | Announces mod presence, version, conflicts |
| `NetPackagePCLock` | Server→Clients | Broadcasts container lock/unlock state |
| `NetPackagePCConfigSync` | Server→Client | Sends server config to joining clients |

#### Race Condition Handling

| Scenario | Problem | Solution |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Unlock arrives before Lock | Ghost lock | **Last-write-wins**: Packets have timestamps, only newer packets apply |
| Lock fails, retry collides with Unlock | Stale lock | **Retry cancellation**: Lock retry checks if container still locked before sending |
| Player disconnects abruptly | Orphan lock | **Orphan cleanup**: ClearTileEntityLockForClient patch broadcasts unlock |
| All above fail | Permanent ghost lock | **Lock expiration**: Locks auto-expire after 5 minutes (configurable) |
| High latency (>500ms) | Stale state | **Eventual consistency**: Acceptable trade-off; logged for diagnostics |

#### Lock Expiration (Self-Healing)

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Lock added at T=0      T=30s                                   │
│      │                     │                                   │
│      ▼                     ▼                                   │
│  ┌───────┐            ┌───────┐                                │
│  │LOCKED │────────────│EXPIRED│ → Auto-removed on next access  │
│  └───────┘            └───────┘                                │
│                                                                │
│  Locks auto-expire after 30 seconds (internal default).        │
│  30 seconds is plenty for any normal container interaction.    │
│  Ghost locks self-heal quickly without blocking functionality. │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Expiration checked lazily (only when accessing container)
- No background threads or heartbeats
- Self-healing: ghost locks eventually resolve without intervention
- 5 minutes is long enough for any normal operation

#### Error Handling Philosophy

| Priority | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| 1st | **Never crash** - All network operations wrapped in try-catch |
| 2nd | **Prefer "available" over "locked"** - Ghost unlocks better than ghost locks |
| 3rd | **Log everything** - Errors logged for diagnostics |
| 4th | **Eventual consistency** - Brief item duplication better than permanent dysfunction |

**Packet deserialization failure:** Defaults to `unlock=true` (safe default)

**Connection unavailable:** Retry once after 500ms, then give up with warning

**High latency (>500ms):** Warning logged, packet still processed

## Inspiration & Prior Art

ProxiCraft builds on concepts from these mods:

| Mod | Author | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| [CraftFromContainers](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2196) | aedenthorn | Original concept for A20 |
| [BeyondStorage2](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/7809) | gazorper ([GitHub](https://github.com/superguru/7d2d_mod_BeyondStorage2)) | Expanded features, storage priority |

If you prefer their versions, check them out! ProxiCraft is a from-scratch implementation with different architecture.

**Use only ONE craft-from-containers mod.** Remove CraftFromContainers, BeyondStorage2, or similar mods before using ProxiCraft.

## Changelog

### v1.2.8 - Multiplayer Crash Fix

**Fixed:**
- Fixed multiplayer crash when client opens containers (reported by users in Russia and US)
- Fixed "Player Unknown" showing instead of actual player name during handshake
- Fixed rare crashes during player disconnect

**New:**
- Added crash diagnostics to `pc_debug.log`
- Log file now self-manages size

### v1.2.7 - Network Stability & Robustness Improvements

**Fixed:**
- Fixed multiplayer handshake packet loss causing mod to lock up for entire server session
- Fixed orphan container locks when players disconnect (containers no longer stay "locked" forever)
- Fixed race condition where out-of-order packets could cause ghost locks (last-write-wins ordering)
- Added lock expiration (30 sec default) - ghost locks self-heal quickly
- Added retry mechanism for handshake and lock broadcasts on temporary connection hiccups
- Added lock retry cancellation to prevent stale locks after rapid open/close
- Added network latency diagnostics for troubleshooting slow connections
- Improved error handling in packet deserialization

**Robustness Improvements:**
- Added defensive measures for rare edge cases during item removal operations:
  - Pre-check TileEntity.IsRemoving before container access (prevents crash if block destroyed mid-operation)
  - Chunk read locks with proper finally blocks during modifications (prevents crash if chunk unloads)
  - Defensive bounds and null checks in all item iteration loops
  - Try-catch wrappers with automatic cleanup and `[CrashPrevention]` logging to pc_debug.log and Player.log

### v1.2.6 - Config File Bug Fix

**Fixed:**
- Fixed config settings being overwritten on game load
- Fixed race condition in config file watcher
- Fixed potential integer overflow in item count cache

### v1.2.5 - Hosting Panel Compatibility

**Fixed:**
- Fixed mod failing to load on some dedicated server hosting panels (CubeCoders AMP, etc.)

**For Server Hosts (if auto-detection still fails):**

You can manually tell ProxiCraft where it's installed by setting an environment variable called `PROXICRAFT_PATH` to the full folder path (e.g., `C:\GameServers\7DaysToDie\Mods\ProxiCraft`).

**Windows 10/11:**
1. Press `Win + R` to open Run dialog
2. Type `sysdm.cpl` and press Enter
3. Click the **Advanced** tab
4. Click **Environment Variables** button at the bottom
