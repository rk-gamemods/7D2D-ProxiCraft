**Safety Features:**
- **Immediate Lock** - Storage access blocked instantly when any client connects (zero crash window)
- **Quick Unlock** - Resumes in ~100-300ms after verifying client has mod
- **Culprit Identification** - Shows exactly which player needs to install the mod
- **Auto Re-enable** - Mod unlocks when the player without ProxiCraft disconnects
- **Server Config Sync** - Clients automatically use server's settings

**Safety Settings (config.json):**

```json
{
  "multiplayerImmediateLock": true,
  "multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds": 10
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `multiplayerImmediateLock` | true | Lock mod when clients connect. Set to `false` for honor system (NOT RECOMMENDED). |
| `multiplayerHandshakeTimeoutSeconds` | 10 | How long to wait before declaring a player doesn't have the mod. |

⚠️ **WARNING:** Setting `multiplayerImmediateLock=false` removes crash protection. Only use on moderated servers where you enforce mod installation externally.

**Testing Status:**
- Single player ✅
- Basic dedicated server ✅
- Co-op hosting ⚠️ (needs more testing)
- High-latency connections ⚠️ (needs more testing)
- Large player counts (8+) ⚠️ (needs more testing)

**🐛 Please Report Bugs!** Multiplayer has many edge cases. Run `pc fullcheck` - it saves `fullcheck_report.txt` to the mod folder. Attach that file to your report on GitHub or Nexus.

## Installation

### Single-Player

1. Download the zip using the link above
2. Extract to `7 Days To Die/Mods/ProxiCraft/`
3. Launch game with EAC disabled

### Multiplayer

1. Install on the **server**
2. Install on **ALL clients** (same version)
3. If hosting co-op: the host IS the server, so all players need the mod

---

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` in the mod folder:

```json
{
  "modEnabled": true,
  "isDebug": false,
  "range": 15,

  "pullFromVehicles": true,
  "pullFromDrones": true,
  "pullFromDewCollectors": true,
  "pullFromWorkstationOutputs": true,
  "allowLockedContainers": true,

  "storagePriority": {
    "Drone": "1",
    "DewCollector": "2",
    "Workstation": "3",
    "Container": "4",
    "Vehicle": "5"
  },

  "enableForCrafting": true,
  "enableForQuests": true,
  "enableForRepairAndUpgrade": true,
  "enableForLockpicking": true,
  "enableForItemRepair": true,
  "enableForPainting": true,
  "enableForReload": true,
  "enableForRefuel": true,
  "enableForTrader": true,
  "enableForGeneratorRefuel": true,

  "enableHudAmmoCounter": true,
  "enableRecipeTrackerUpdates": true,
  "respectLockedSlots": true
}
```

### Key Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `range` | 15 | Search radius in blocks. Use 5 (same room), 15 (same floor), 30 (entire building), or -1 (unlimited). |
| `storagePriority` | See above | Lower number = checked first. Items pulled from first available source. |
| `respectLockedSlots` | true | Skip items in user-locked container slots. |
| `pullFromWorkstationOutputs` | true | Only OUTPUT slots counted (not input/fuel/tool). |

---

## Console Commands

Open console with F1:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pc status` | Show mod status, config, and multiplayer state |
| `pc health` | Show startup health check results |
| `pc test` | Test container scanning (shows what's found) |
| `pc fullcheck` | Full diagnostic (saves to `fullcheck_report.txt`) |
| `pc conflicts` | Check for mod conflicts |
| `pc toggle` | Enable/disable mod temporarily |
| `pc reload` | Reload config from file |
| `pc perf on/off/report` | Performance profiling |

### Configuration Commands

```
pc config list              # List all settings
pc set range 30             # Change range to 30
pc config save              # Save changes to file
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Single-Player Issues

1. **Check status:** `pc status` - Is mod enabled?
2. **Check health:** `pc health` - Are features working?
3. **Test scanning:** `pc test` - Can mod see containers?
4. **Full report:** `pc fullcheck` - Saves `fullcheck_report.txt` for bug reports

### Multiplayer Issues

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Multiplayer: LOCKED" in `pc status` | A player doesn't have ProxiCraft installed. Check who. |
| Features don't work for some players | Ensure ALL players have same mod version |
| Settings different than expected | Server settings override client. Check server's config.json |
| CTD on player join | Run `pc fullcheck`, attach `fullcheck_report.txt` |

### Stability Philosophy

ProxiCraft is designed to survive game updates:

| Tier | Features | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| **Stable** | Crafting, Quests, Block Repair, Lockpicking, Item Repair, Painting, HUD, Recipe Tracker | Low - Simple postfix patches |
| **Less Stable** | Reload, Vehicle Refuel, Generator Refuel, Trader | Medium - Transpiler patches |
| **Storage Sources** | Vehicles, Drones, Dew Collectors, Workstations | Low - Read-only, no patches |

**Startup Health Check:** Validates all 24 patches on game load. Silent when OK, warns on issues.

**Adaptive Recovery:** If game updates change method names, the mod attempts to find renamed methods automatically.

### Design Decisions

**Workstation Slots:** Only OUTPUT slots are counted. Input (being processed), fuel (being burned), and tool slots (in use) are ignored.

**Virtual Inventory Architecture:** All storage operations flow through `VirtualInventoryProvider` - centralizes multiplayer safety, ensures consistent behavior, enables global bug fixes.

## Inspiration & Prior Art

ProxiCraft builds on concepts from these mods:

| Mod | Author | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| [CraftFromContainers](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2196) | aedenthorn | Original concept for A20 |
| [BeyondStorage2](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/7809) | gazorper ([GitHub](https://github.com/superguru/7d2d_mod_BeyondStorage2)) | Expanded features, storage priority |

If you prefer their versions, check them out! ProxiCraft is a from-scratch implementation with different architecture.

**Use only ONE craft-from-containers mod.** Remove CraftFromContainers, BeyondStorage2, or similar mods before using ProxiCraft.
