[size=4][b]What This Means for You:[/b][/size]

[b]If you're a new user:[/b] Fresh installations will automatically use Enhanced Safety Mode, which routes operations through a centralized safety layer (VirtualInventoryProvider) for more consistent multiplayer behavior.

[b]If you're an existing user:[/b] Your custom [b]config.json[/b] is unchanged - you keep your current settings. Only fresh installations use the new defaults.

[b]Why the change?[/b] Enhanced Safety Mode was previously marked "experimental" and disabled by default, but extensive testing has shown it to be robust and safe. It provides:
[list]
[*]More consistent multiplayer behavior
[*]Simplified code paths (easier to maintain)
[*]No performance cost
[*]Functionally equivalent to standard mode for single-player
[/list]
